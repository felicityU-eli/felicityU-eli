# 👋 Hello, I'm Eli!

I'm a 4th-year **Mechatronics Engineering student** from Talisay, Batangas, turning ideas into tangible creations with code and machines. At 21 years old, I’m constantly exploring new ways to bridge the gap between imagination and reality, always curious and passionate about technology.

## 🎯 What drives me:
- **Mechatronics Magic**: Crafting projects that bring together mechanics, electronics, and computing to make things smarter.
- **Baking**: Just as I love engineering precision, I find joy in the science of baking – turning flour into something delicious. 🍪
- **Exploration**: I'm always learning, discovering new tools and techniques to improve my skills.

## 🎨 Current Fascination:
I'm on a quest to build my own version of **Baymax** – a personal health companion bot! 🤖 Inspired by my love for robotics and design, this project is a perfect challenge to blend my engineering skills with creativity.

## 🛠️ My Tech Stack:
- **Languages**: Python, C++, MATLAB
- **Hardware**: Arduino, Sensors, Actuators
- **Design**: SolidWorks, AutoCAD

## ✨ Let's Connect:
I’m always open to discussing new ideas, collaborations, or just sharing baking tips! Feel free to reach out or check out my repositories to see what I'm working on.
